# Aston Events API

This piece of coursework was awarded **100%**.

For my Internet *Applications and Techniques* module I was tasked with building an events system for Aston University. This system allowed students to organise and find events happening at Aston.

This RESTful API was built using Laravel and includes a full test suite - test away! It allows students to find, favourite, create, update and delete Events - allowing them to carry out advanced creation through a WYSIWYG editor, multiple image upload and advanced searching with Algolia!

Check out the [Vue.js SPA](https://github.com/Joshgallagher/aston-events-spa) that consumes this API!
